# Curvature-Flow-Equation
The file Main.m is the entry point. We can run the script by:
1)  Main :  
It will import all the functions
2) Start(#spatialdiscretization,#timesteps,#t0 = initial time,#tf = final 
time,#curvenumber)
It will start the execution
Curvenumber=1,2,3 for three curves above.
Above code was run by:
Curve1: 
Start (512,30000,0,4,1)
etc.
